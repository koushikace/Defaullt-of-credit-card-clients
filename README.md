# Defaullt-of-credit-card-clients
ID: ID of each client
LIMIT_BAL: Amount of the given credit (in New Taiwan dollar)
SEX: Gender (1 = male; 2 = female)
EDUCATION: Education level (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others)
MARRIAGE: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others)
AGE: Age (in years)
PAY_0 - PAY_6: Payment status from April to September, 2005 (-2 = no consumption; -1 = paid in full; 0 = use of revolving credit; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; ...; 8 = payment delay for eight months or more)
BILL_AMT1 - BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement from April to September, 2005 (in New Taiwan dollar)
PAY_AMT1 - PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment from April to September, 2005 (in New Taiwan dollar)
default payment next month: Default payment (1 = yes, 0 = no)

There are several types of models you can create from the "default of credit card clients" dataset, depending on the specific problem you are trying to solve. Here are some examples:

1. Binary classification model: This type of model predicts whether a credit card client will default on their payment in the next month. You could use machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks to create this type of model.

2. Multi-class classification model: This type of model predicts the probability of default for each client, but instead of a continuous variable, it predicts a categorical variable with more than two classes. You could use algorithms such as multinomial logistic regression or support vector machines to create this type of model.

3. Regression model: This type of model estimates the probability of default for each client as a continuous variable. You could use algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks to create this type of model.

4. Clustering model: This type of model groups clients into clusters based on their demographic and financial information. You could use algorithms such as k-means clustering or hierarchical clustering to create this type of model.

5. Association rule mining model: This type of model identifies patterns in the dataset, such as which demographic or financial variables are most strongly associated with default. You could use algorithms such as Apriori or FP-growth to create this type of model.

These are just a few examples of the types of models you can create from this dataset. The specific type of model you choose will depend on the problem you are trying to solve and the insights you want to gain from the data.
